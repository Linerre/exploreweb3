I'm using this repository to explore the rich ecosystem of Web3. In particular, the libraries commonly used to interact and communicate with various blockchains.

The repository will be script-heavy and use languages such as JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and Go.

To try out some of the scripts, follow the instructions in the READMEs in the subdirs.
